# Seating Layout Builder Documentation

This documentation tracks the development of the POS Seating Layout Builder feature.

## Quick Links

- **[SUMMARY.md](./SUMMARY.md)** - Comprehensive walkthrough of all completed features
- **[fix-save-failure/](./fix-save-failure/)** - Detailed walkthrough of the save validation fix (kept as reference)

## Documentation Organization

Completed features are documented in `SUMMARY.md` with links to detailed walkthroughs where applicable. Individual task folders are removed once consolidated into the summary to reduce clutter.

## Active Work

For active development tasks, create subdirectories following the pattern:

```
feature-name/
├── task.md                  # Checklist of work items
├── implementation_plan.md   # Technical design
└── walkthrough.md           # Verification and summary
```

Once work is complete and verified, add a summary to `SUMMARY.md` and remove the task folder.
